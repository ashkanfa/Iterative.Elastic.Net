# Iterative.Elastic.Net
A feature selection technique which targets **"True Underlying Features"** compared to feature selection for "pure predictive" purpose. In the pure observational setting, true feature selection or uncovering the true underlying model is a practical challenge and a controversial task to accomplish. This is even harder when the data under study are highly correlated and the aim is to detect causation versus correlation. Under this condition, we propose a new requlrized method, **Iterative Elastic Net (ITELNET)** with a unique model selection metric that outperforms other current LASSO type modeling techniques (Adaptive LASSO, Elastic NET) in discovering the true underlying model. The content of this research is going to be published officialy later.
